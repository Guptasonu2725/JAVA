Dijkstra's Algorithm Visualizer:
This project is a graphical visualizer of Dijkstra's Algorithm built using Java Swing and AWT. The application provides an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) that allows users to input nodes and edges to construct a weighted graph. Once the graph is plotted, users can run Dijkstra's Algorithm to visualize the shortest path between a selected start node and all other nodes in the graph.

Features
Interactive GUI: Users can create nodes, add edges with weights, and build a custom graph structure.
Shortest Path Visualization: After the graph is built, users can select a starting node to execute Dijkstra's Algorithm and visualize the shortest paths in real time.
Distance Display: Displays the shortest distances from the starting node to each reachable node on the graph.
User-Friendly Interface: Simple and intuitive design for easy interaction.

This project provides an educational and interactive approach to understanding Dijkstra's Algorithm by illustrating how it explores paths and calculates distances step-by-step.
